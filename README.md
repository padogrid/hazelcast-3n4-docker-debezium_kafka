# Debezium-Kafka Hazelcast Connector

This bundle integrates Hazelcast with Debezium for ingesting initial data and CDC records from MySQL into a Hazelcast cluster via a Kafka sink connector included in the `hazelcast-addon` distribution. It supports inserts, updates and deletes.

## Installing Bundle

This bundle supports Hazelcast 3.12.x and 4.0.

```console
install_bundle -download hazelcast-3n4-docker-debezium_kafka
```

## Use Case

This use case ingests data changes made in the MySQL database into a Hazelcast cluster via Kafka connectors: the Debezium MySQL source connector and the `hazelcast-addon` Debezium sink connector.

## Debezium Tutorial

The demo follows the Debezium Totorial steps shown in the link below.

https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/1.0/tutorial.html#registering-connector-monitor-inventory-database

All the commands provided in the tutorial are wrapped in the scripts found in the `bin_sh` directory. We'll use these scripts to simplify the demo.

## Building Demo

We must first build the demo by running the `build_app` command as shown below. This command compiles and packages the `VersionedPortable` data (domain) classes found in the source directory `src`. It also copies the Hazelcast and `hazelcast-addon` jar files to the Docker container mounted volume in the `hazelcast-addon` directory so that the Hazelcast Debezium Kafka connector can include them in its class path.

```console
cd_docker debezium_kafka; cd bin_sh
./build_app
```

Upon successful build, the `hazelcast-addon` directory should have jar files similar to the following:

```console
cd_docker debezium_kafka
tree hazelcast-addon
```

```console
hazelcast-addon/
├── etc
│   └── hazelcast-client.xml
├── lib
│   ├── hazelcast-addon-common-0.9.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
│   ├── hazelcast-addon-core-4-0.9.0-SNAPSHOT.jarr
│   └── hazelcast-enterprise-all-4.0.jar
├── log
└── plugins
    ├── debezium-demo-data-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
    └── hazelcast-addon-core-4-0.9.0-SNAPSHOT-tests.jar
```


## Creating Hazelcast Docker Containers

Let's create a Hazelcast cluster to run on Docker containers as follows.

```console
create_docker -cluster hazelcast -host host.docker.internal
cd_docker hazelcast
```

If you are running Docker Desktop, then the host name, `host.docker.internal`, is accessible from the containers as well as the host machine. You can run the `ping` command to check the host name.

```console
ping host.docker.internal
```

If `host.docker.internal` is not defined then you will need to use the host IP address that can be accessed from both the Docker containers and the host machine. Run `create_docker -?` or `man create_docker` to see the usage.

```console
create_docker -?
```

If you are using a host IP other than `host.docker.internal` then you must also make the change in the Debezium Hazelcast connector configuration file as follows.

```console
cd_docker debezium_kafka
vi hazelcast-addon/etc/hazelcast-client.xml
```

Replace `host.docker.internal` in `hazelcast-client.xml` with your host IP address.

```xml
<hazelcast-client ...>
   ...
   <network>
      <cluster-members>
         <address>host.docker.internal:5701</address>
         <address>host.docker.internal:5702</address>
      </cluster-members>
   </network>
   ...
</hazelcast-client>
```

### Configuring Hazelcast Cluster

If you will be querying Hazelcast, then you must register the `VersionedPortable` factory class we have built in the previous section. For example, you can use the `desktop` app to query and browse the data in the Hazelcast cluster. **You can skip this section if you won't be querying data.**

Edit `hazelcast.xml` and register the portable factory class as shown below.

```console
cd_docker hazelcast
vi hazelcast-addon/etc/hazelcast.xml
```

```xml
<hazelcast ...>
   ...
   <serialization>
      ...
      <portable-factory factory-id="20001">
      org.hazelcast.addon.demo.debezium.data.PortableFactoryImpl
      </portable-factory>
      ...
   </serialization>
   ...
</hazelcast>
```

Copy the demo data jar file into the `plugins` directory as follows.

```console
cd_docker hazelcast
cp $HAZELCAST_ADDON_WORKSPACE/docker/debezium_kafka/hazelcast-addon/plugins/debezium-demo-data-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar hazelcast-addon/plugins/
```

## Starting Docker Containers

There are numerous Docker containers to this demo. We'll first start the Hazelcast cluster containers and then proceed with the Debezium containers. For this demo, we intentionally made each container to run in the foreground so that you can view the log events. You will need to launch a total of eight (8) terminals. 

### Start Hazelcast Containers

Start the `hazelcast` Hazelcast cluster containers.

```console
cd_docker hazelcast
docker-compose up
```

### Start Debezium Containers

Launch six (6) terminals and run each script from their own terminal as shown below. Each script must be run from their own terminal as they will block and display log messages.

```console
cd_docker debezium_kafka; cd bin_sh

# 1. Start Zookeeper
./start_zookeeper

# 2. Start Kafka
./start_kafka

# 3. Start MySQL database
./start_mysql

# 4. Start MySQL CLI
./start_mysql_cli

# 5. Start Kafka Connect
./start_kafka_connect

# 6. Start topic watcher
./watch_topic_customers
```

### Register Kafka Connect via REST API

There are two (2) Kafka connectors that we must register. The MySQL connector is provided by Debezium and the Hazelcast connector is part of the `hazelcast-addon` distribution. 

```console
cd_docker debezium_kafka; cd bin_sh
./register_mysql_connector
./register_debezium_hazelcast_connector
```

### Check Kafka Connect

```console
# Check status
curl -Ss -H "Accept:application/json" localhost:8083/ | jq

# List registered connectors 
curl -Ss -H "Accept:application/json" localhost:8083/connectors/ | jq
```

The last command should display the inventory connector that we registered previously.

```console
[
  "debezium-hazelcast-sink",
  "inventory-connector"
]
```

### MySQL CLI

Using the MySQL CLI, you can change table contents. The changes you make will be captured in the form of change events by the Debezium source connector. The Hazelcast sink connector in turn receives the change events, transforms them into data objects and updates (or deletes) the assigned map, i.e., `inventory/customers`.

```console
use inventory;
SELECT * FROM customers;
UPDATE customers SET first_name='Anne Marie' WHERE id=1004;
-- Delete - First, delete the row in addresses that references the foreign key
DELETE FROM addresses WHERE customer_id=1004;
DELETE FROM customers WHERE id=1004;

INSERT INTO customers VALUES (default, "Sarah", "Thompson", "kitt@acme.com");
INSERT INTO customers VALUES (default, "Kenneth", "Anderson", "kander@acme.com");
```

### View Map Contents

To view the map contents, run the `read_cache` command as follows:

```console
./read_cache inventory/customers
```

**Output:**

```console
Map Values [inventory/customers]:
        [email=gbailey@foobar.com, firstName=George, id=1002, lastName=Bailey]
        [email=sally.thomas@acme.com, firstName=Sally, id=1001, lastName=Thomas]
        [email=ed@walker.com, firstName=Edward, id=1003, lastName=Walker]
        [email=annek@noanswer.org, firstName=Anne Marie, id=1004, lastName=Kretchmar]
```

### Desktop

You can also install the desktop app and browse and query the map contents.

```console
create_app -app desktop
cd_app desktop; bin_sh
./build_app
```

Upon build completion, copy the demo data jar file to the destkop `plugins` directory.

```console
cd_app desktop
cd hazelcast-desktop_<version>
cp $HAZELCAST_ADDON_WORKSPACE/docker/debezium_kafka/hazelcast-addon/plugins/debezium-demo-data-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar plugins/
```

Edit the `pado.properties` file and enter the `PortableFactoryImpl` class as follows.

```console
vi etc/pado.properties
```

```properties
hazelcast.client.config.serialization.portable.factories=1:org.hazelcast.demo.nw.data.PortableFactoryImpl,\
10000:org.hazelcast.addon.hql.impl.PortableFactoryImpl,\
20001:org.hazelcast.addon.demo.debezium.data.PortableFactoryImpl
```

Run the desktop.

```console
cd bin_sh
./desktop
```

## Tearing Down

```console
# Shutdown Debezium containers
cd_docker debezium_kafka; cd bin_sh
./cleanup

# Shutdown Hazelcast containers
cd_docker hazelcast
docker-compose down

# Prune all stopped containers 
docker container prune
```
